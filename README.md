# Transformer in PyTorch

My transformer implementation for machine translation similar to "Attention is all you need" also trained on WMT2014.

BPE implementation: https://github.com/soaxelbrooke/python-bpe

Also used some functions from https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/translation_transformer.html
